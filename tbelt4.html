		 <p class="text">Pulling the engine created a fair number of obstacles that needed to be overcome. Most signficant were the 19mm bolts securing the bellhousing to the engine block. The top bolts are positioned so that it's pretty hard to get at them without an offset wrench. Even then, it's hard to generate enough force to break them free without causing the wrench to slip off the bolt. After wasting several hours without success, I decided that the bellhousing was going to come out with the engine. That meant I had to disconnect the bellhousing from the torque tube. That was much easier. Once the bellhousing was free, I finished disconnecting everything else and tried to lift the engine. It came up about 6 inches and started bringing the whole car up with it. After a few more hours of trying to figure this out, I saw that the transmission cable that runs along the top of the torque tube was holding the engine. The metal bracket securing the cable to the bellhousing was actually strong enough to lift the car. Again, the fact that this bracket is in a hard to reach spot and it's being frozen in place for 20 years made removal difficult. I ended up using a Dremel to cut it. The engine came up a few more inches and got stuck again...this time on the fuel injection wiring harness. I couldn't push the harness through the firewall, so I needed to disconnect it from the various locations on top of the engine. With that done, the engine came out:</p>
